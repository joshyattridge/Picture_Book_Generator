The day is done at rocket base,  
The sun is hiding its bright face.  
Behind the lunar hills so high,  
The stars and moon light up the sky.

Rockets tall and silver bright  
Murmur softly, “Goodnight, goodnight.”  
They fold their wings and close their eyes,  
And dream of dancing in the skies.

Rover rolls back to its bed,  
Wheels are tired, ready for rest ahead.  
It parks beside a moon rock pile,  
Yawns a yawn and sleeps in style.

Friendly robots wave hello,  
Beep goodnight before they go.  
They stack their tools and sweep the floor,  
Then tiptoe quietly out the door.

Little lamps flicker soft and warm.  
They keep the base safe from harm.  
Soft lights twinkle, small and bright,  
Making shadows in the night.

Spacesuits hang so neat and straight,  
Waiting for the next launch date.  
Boots are lined up, helmets gleam,  
All ready for a spaceman’s dream.

The mission maps are put away,  
Drawings of stars and moons at play.  
The screen now glows with silver light,  
And whispers softly, “Sleep well tonight.”

The team has worked from noon till night,  
Building, fixing, flying right.  
Helping friends and being kind,  
With brave and cheerful hearts combined.

Tiny beds for astronauts small,  
Blankets cozy, pillows tall.  
Into each bed they snuggle tight,  
Safe and warm till morning light.

Outside, the rockets hum a tune,  
Under the watchful, smiling moon.  
Comets twinkle and swirl past,  
Dreams of space adventures last.

With everyone tucked snug in bed,  
Dreams of planets fill each head.  
Rockets, rovers, robots too,  
All hope their dreams will come true.

Goodnight to all at rocket base,  
Goodnight to every sleepy face.  
Sun and moon both share the sky,  
Goodnight, goodnight, don’t be shy!

In the garden under the sun,  
Mommy grows melons by the ton.  
Round and green and oh so sweet,  
Her melons ripen in the heat.

Mommy lifts her melons high,  
Balancing them as she walks by.  
Careful, careful, big and round,  
Wobbling, wobbling close to the ground.

Mommy says, "My melons grew tall!  
They’re the biggest ones of all!"  
Daddy grins and gives a wink,  
"Those are juicy, I do think!"

Sometimes the melons roll away,  
Bumping, bouncing as they play.  
Mommy chases, giggling loud,  
Her melons wobble, round and proud.

When Mommy tries to pick up two,  
She wobbles like the kangaroos!  
She gives a laugh, and so do I,  
Watching those melons pass on by.

The neighbors stop and stare in awe,  
At Mommy’s melons, big and raw.  
They ask her, “How’d you grow them fast?”  
She smiles and says, “With love, at last!”

We wash them up and make them shine,  
Lined up in a row, they look so fine.  
Mommy hugs her melons close,  
“These are the ones I love the most!”

Slicing melons for a treat,  
Red and juicy, oh so sweet!  
Sticky fingers, faces too,  
We slurp and smile—do you do too?

Sometimes dogs will sniff around,  
Looking for melons on the ground.  
Mommy shouts, “Hey, not for you!  
My melons belong in our stew!”

Grandma visits with a grin,  
She wants Mommy’s melons to win!  
“All the melons I have seen,  
Yours are the biggest I’ve ever seen!”

At the fair, they take the prize,  
Mommy’s melons catch all eyes.  
Shining, gleaming in the sun,  
Being silly is such fun!

So when you see a melon big,  
Don’t be shy—go take a swig!  
And if you see them at our stand,  
Mommy’s melons are the best in the land!

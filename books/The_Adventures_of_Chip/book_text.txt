Chip the guinea pig woke with a hop, ready for breakfast that would not stop. He wiggled and stretched and gave a big yawn, while sunlight shined brightly to say, "Come on!"

Josh was still sleeping, all snuggly and warm. Vicky was dreaming without a care or alarm. But Chip was awake and ready to play, eager to find adventure today.

First, he tiptoed quietly out of his bed, using his nose and his tiny brown head. He sniffed around looking for something to eat, and soon found some slippers that smelled kind of sweet.

Chip nibbled the laces, but they were not food. They tasted too chewy and not very good. Suddenly, Vicky called out, "Where’s Chip gone to?" She looked by her bed and under her shoe.

Josh rubbed his eyes and got out of his bunk. He laughed when he saw the slippers all shrunk. "Oh Chip," he giggled, "you silly old thing," as Chip hopped away with a wiggle and spring.

Next, Chip scurried into the kitchen so bright, looking for snacks that might taste just right. He saw a big cookie sitting on a plate. "That’s just the thing for a treat I can’t wait!"

He climbed up a box and stretched out real far, and just as he reached, he tipped over a jar. The cookie rolled down with a crash and a clink, and Chip took a nibble before he could think.

But then, oh no, in came Vicky and Josh. They saw Chip with crumbs and a sugary squash. They couldn’t stay mad, not for too long—they just had to smile and sing him a song.

After his snack, Chip wanted to run. He darted outside for some guinea pig fun. He rolled in the grass and hopped through a loop, and he spotted a butterfly flying in swoop.

Chip chased the butterfly all the way up the tree, and he climbed a branch as proud as can be. But guinea pigs aren’t made for heights so tall. He squeaked, “Help me down, I don’t like this at all!”

Josh held out his hands and called, “Come to me!” Vicky stood close by the old apple tree. Chip jumped right in and landed with ease, happy to be safe and off from his knees.

Josh and Vicky hugged Chip and then said, "No more adventures until it's time for bed." But Chip only winked as he cuddled in tight, thinking, "Tomorrow I'll find new trouble. Goodnight!"

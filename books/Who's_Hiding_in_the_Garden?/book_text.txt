Who's hiding in the garden today  
Little feet tip-toe out to play  
The sun is warm and the grass feels sweet  
What tiny friends will we meet

Behind the flowerpot what’s that sound  
Flap goes the lid a beetle is found  
Black and shiny it scurries fast  
Be gentle and let beetles pass

By the lettuce leaves lies something small  
Lift up the leaf a snail starts to crawl  
It carries its house and slides along  
A leaf for dinner and a quiet song

In the muddy patch something jumps up high  
Peek under the stone a worm wiggles by  
Worms love the earth and the rain so cool  
Let’s help the worms by making a shade pool

Under a petal something buzzes near  
Flap the petal a bee appears here  
Bees sip nectar and fly flower to flower  
Plant some seeds to give bees power

By the old log what’s hiding from view  
Lift up the bark a spider peeks through  
It spins a web to catch a fly  
Let’s let the spider say hi

Near the tiny pond frogs sit in a line  
Move the lily pad what green toes shine  
Frogs love clean water and bugs to eat  
We’ll keep the pond tidy for a frog treat

On the tall sunflower who flies so bright  
Lift the big leaf a butterfly takes flight  
With colorful wings fluttering by  
Plant more flowers to help butterflies

Under the garden bench a moth is still  
Flap goes the cushion it sits so chill  
Moths like the night and the moon so wide  
Let them rest during the day and hide

At the berry bush something rustles with glee  
Push aside leaves there’s a ladybug to see  
Spots on its back and red so bold  
Ladybugs love stories whispered and told

Down in the herbs ants march in a row  
Lift up some thyme and watch them go  
Ants clean up crumbs to keep the garden neat  
Let’s leave them crumbs as a tiny treat

The sun starts to set the sky turns red  
Time to go in and rest your head  
The garden is quiet friends hidden from view  
Tomorrow they’ll play hide and seek with you

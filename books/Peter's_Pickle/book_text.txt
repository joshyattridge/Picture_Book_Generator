Peter had a pickle, it was quite a sight to see,  
Larger than a watermelon, as green as green can be.  
He tried to keep it hidden, tucked beneath his bed,  
But when it wouldn't fit there, he scratched his little head.

One bright sunny morning, the pickle took a roll,  
Slipped past Peter’s doorstep, gaining major stroll.  
Down the village cobblestones, wobbling to and fro,  
People stopped and giggled as it put on quite a show.

The baker watched it wobble past his little shop,  
He chuckled and he muttered, "I wish it wouldn't stop."  
His bread began to tremble as that pickle slipped away,  
"Looks like Peter's pickle has come out to play!"

When it passed the barber, oh what a sight to see,  
He dropped his combs and scissors, perched so carefully.  
With a wink and a snicker, he joined the pickle chase,  
“Come back, Peter's pickle! You’re picking up the pace!”

At the school, the children pointed with great glee,  
“Peter's pickle's coming, as grand as grand can be!”  
They hopped and they hollered, as it bounced along the wall,  
Looking for a spot where it wouldn't roll at all.

Peter ran behind it, face red as a beet,  
Trying to retrieve it, scampering on his feet.  
But that cheeky pickle had a will of its own,  
It zigged and zagged and twirled, not wanting to be shown.

As it reached the market, the vendors gave a cheer,  
"That there is a pickle worthy of a peer!"  
It brushed past the lettuce, it danced by a pear,  
Leaving all the shoppers pointing with a stare.

By now the town was buzzing, tipsy with the fun,  
Peter panted loudly, for the chase was never done.  
“I’ve got to catch it quick, before it hits the park,  
Before the dogs decide they want to leave their mark!”

The pickle took a tumble near the fountain's spray,  
Peter made a leaping grab, "Oh no, not today!"  
He caught his breath and seized it, with triumphant show,  
A heroic little savior of his pickle in tow.

The townsfolk clapped and cheered as Peter held it tight,  
"Your pickle’s quite the wonder, a green, amazing sight!"  
With pickle safely captured, he walked back to his house,  
Tip-toeing lightly, quiet as a mouse.

For Peter's grand adventure, with his pickle now complete,  
He knew to keep it guarded, a secret little treat.  
But sometimes late at night, when all the lights are low,  
That big and silly pickle whispers “Time to go!”

With dreams of grand adventures still dancing in his head,  
Peter snuggled gently, tucked away in bed.  
His pickle now well-hidden, but his heart so full of fun,  
His dreams began to wander, "What if it went for a run?”

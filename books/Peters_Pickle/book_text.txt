In a town that was small, with not much to see,  
Lived a boy named Peter as happy as can be.  
Peter had a pickle, oh, what a sight!  
It was taller than rooftops, a towering delight!  
He'd roll it down Main Street, to the awe of the crowd,  
But that gherkin would gurgle, wibble-wobble so loud.  
It toppled the fruit stand, then crashed through the shop,  
Adults waved and laughed, while the kids yelled, "Don't stop!"

The mayor looked worried, his spectacles askew,  
"The streets are not made for a pickle or two!"  
But Peter just chuckled, with a mischievous grin,  
"My pickle's too large, let's invite it within!"  
In the schoolyard it played, sliding down the big slide,  
While teachers exclaimed, "It's a bumpy old ride!"  
The children would giggle and cheer with delight,  
As Peter's big pickle rolled into the night.

Then one day it happened, a curious scene,  
As Peter's large pickle turned a grassy bright green.  
Mrs. Plum's garden, always tidy and neat,  
Was now full of cucumbers, quite hard to beat!  
Yet everyone laughed, with no frowns to be found,  
For Peter's big pickle had brought joy all around.  
"Letâ€™s pickle and party!" the whole town agreed,  
And Peter's huge pickle rolled on, at full speed!

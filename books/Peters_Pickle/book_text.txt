Peter had a pickle, green and plump and quite a sight,  
He showed it to his neighbor, who jumped back with a fright!  
It wobbled down the driveway, like a jiggly jelly roll,  
With every single bounce and squash, it made a perfect hole!

Rolling down the street, it grew a curious crowd,  
Mrs. Baker watched it pass, and laughed out loud!  
"I've seen all sorts of pickles, but this one's really grand!  
It’s causing such a ruckus, the town needs to lend a hand!"

The pickle found the playground, where it joined the games,  
It slid the slide and climbed the bars, earning funny names.  
Now everyone in town just waits for Peter’s pickle ride,  
For with each giggle and squeal, the town swells with pride!

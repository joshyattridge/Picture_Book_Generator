Welcome, wee babies, to Gambling Land,  
Where fun little bets go hand in hand.  
Let’s spin some wheels and roll some dice,  
It’s all make-believe and silly, not nice!

Look at the slot machine, bright and big,  
Pull the shiny handle—give it a wig!  
Three smiley faces in a row—  
Ding ding ding! Watch the lights glow!

Poker is next, with cards in a row,  
Colorful shapes fast or slow.  
Hold your cards with chubby hands—  
Will you make the winning stands?

Roll the dice and watch them go,  
Tumble, bounce, and maybe slow.  
If you get a lucky two,  
We all clap and shout for you!

Spin the roulette—red or black,  
Round and round and then right back.  
Put your paci on a spot,  
Let’s see if you win a lot!

Horsey races go so fast,  
Pick the winner, hope you last!  
Cheer for fuzzy horsies, “Neigh!”  
Maybe your horse wins today.

Bingo cards all lined with dots,  
Will you fill them up or not?  
When you match them all in line,  
Shout “BINGO!”—isn’t that fine?

Counting chips like little snacks,  
Green and red and stacks on stacks.  
Push them here or over there,  
Share them with your teddy bear!

Scratch and sniff those cards and win,  
A silly baby prize tucked in.  
If you find three stars or more,  
You’ll giggle, wriggle on the floor!

Put your guess in, pick a game,  
It’s all for fun, it’s not the same!  
Sometimes you win, sometimes you flop,  
But laughs and giggles never stop.

Parents watch and giggle too,  
Knowing games are just for you.  
It’s silly rules and baby fun,  
No real bets, just make-believe won.

So hug your toys and clap with glee,  
Let’s play again, just you and me.  
Gambling for babies is quite a joke,  
A giggly tale for gentle folk!

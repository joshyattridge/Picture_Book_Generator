Welcome to Gambling For Babies. Are you ready to play. Put on your lucky socks and grab your favorite bottle. This is where big fun begins.

First we spin the slot machine. Pull the big handle down with your tiny hand. Watch the colorful pictures go round and round. Hope you get three teddy bears in a row. If not try again. Babies never give up.

Now it is time for cards. This game is called poker. Pretend the cards are tasty cookies. Stack them up and peek at the corners. If you have a big hand say goo goo gaga and smile. That is how you bluff.

Roll the dice. Throw them gently across the floor. Two sixes means super happy baby. Snake eyes make silly faces. Remember when in doubt always double down.

Let us try picking a winner at the baby horse race. Wiggle your stuffed animals as fast as you can. Cheer for your favorite. The slowest horse gets a nap. The winner gets a high five.

Next is bingo. Shout BINGO every time you see a duck or a shoe on the card. Adults will laugh when you yell out loud for a diaper. It is all part of the fun.

Try online betting. Take a pretend phone and tap tap tap. Bet on which cloud will float past the window next. Pro tip never bet against the big fluffy one.

The wheel of fortune goes round and round. Close your eyes and give it a spin. Wherever it stops that is where the giggles start. Everyone claps. Baby wins no matter what.

Do not forget to count your chips. Babies can stack blocks as money. The bigger the stack the richer the baby. But remember sometimes it is more fun to share with a friend.

Now play craps. Roll the dice and hope for a lucky roll. If you roll a seven do a wiggly dance. If you lose make a silly sad face. Grownups might clap anyway.

Lottery time. Pick your numbers from the shiny toy box. Will you win the big prize. Maybe. Hug your blankie for good luck and try again tomorrow.

Gambling for babies is just for giggles. Win or lose it is always more fun together. Keep laughing and rolling and spinning. That is the real jackpot.

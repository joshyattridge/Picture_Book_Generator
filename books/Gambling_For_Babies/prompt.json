  "topic": "Gambling for Babies is a silly, tongue-in-cheek introduction to the world of betting, teaching little ones (and mostly amusing the grown-ups) about all the classic ways to gamble \u2014 from slot machines and poker to horse racing and online bets. With bright, playful illustrations and simple language, it pretends to be a baby-friendly how-to guide for rolling dice, placing bets, and chasing that jackpot, all while making adults laugh at the absurdity of it all.",
  "pages": 12,
  "book_type": "educational how to and introduction",
  "style": "A bright, baby-friendly cartoon style with bold colours, rounded shapes, and cheerful characters that contrast hilariously with the adult gambling themes."

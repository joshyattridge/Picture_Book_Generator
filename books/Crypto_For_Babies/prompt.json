  "topic": "Crypto for Babies is a silly, tongue-in-cheek primer to the topsy-turvy world of digital money \u2014 explaining (and mostly lampooning) bitcoins, blockchains, wallets, mining, NFTs, and rocket-ship price charts. With baby-simple lines and wink-to-the-grown-ups humour, it pretends to teach little ones how to HODL their bottle, avoid dodgy links, and ride the bouncy market, while adults laugh at the absurdity of it all.",

  "style": "A bright, baby-friendly cartoon style with bold colours, rounded shapes, and cheerful characters; visual gags like rattles as hardware wallets, stacking blocks as blockchains, toy diggers as mining rigs, pixel-art animals for NFTs, and bouncy candlestick charts shooting \u2018to the moon\u2019.",

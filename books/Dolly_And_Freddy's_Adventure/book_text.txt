Dolly put on her bright red hat,  
Freddy wagged his tail and sat.  
“We’re off to find the giggle tree!  
Let’s go and see what we can see!”

Freddy barked and spun around,  
Sniffed a flower on the ground.  
Dolly laughed and gave a clap,  
“Butterflies land on Freddy’s lap!”

Through the gate and down the lane,  
Dolly danced, and Freddy came.  
They tiptoed by the bluebird’s nest,  
Trying their very quiet best.

Suddenly, a frog jumped high,  
Landing on Freddy—oh my!  
“Ribbit!” croaked the silly fellow,  
Freddy grinned, his tail like Jell-O.

They marched up the little hill,  
Freddy saw a squirrel so still.  
Dolly waved and said hello,  
The squirrel did a funny show.

Past the pond, the ducks went "quack!"  
Freddy quacked right back,  
Dolly giggled, held her side,  
Freddy acted like a duck with pride.

In the tall and wobbly grass,  
A rabbit hopped, so fast, so fast!  
Dolly tried to follow near,  
Freddy bounced and gave a cheer.

Behind a bush, they heard a sound,  
A lost red ball upon the ground!  
Dolly threw it with a spin,  
Freddy ran and fetched it in.

Under a tree so bright and green,  
They spotted something they had never seen.  
A swing hung from a sturdy limb,  
Dolly pushed and Freddy jumped in.

Round and round, the swing it flew,  
Freddy barked, “Wheeee!” and Dolly too!  
They giggled under the giggle tree,  
As happy as friends could ever be.

The sun was sleepy, turning gold,  
Adventure done, but never old.  
Hand in paw, they skipped along,  
Singing their silly giggle song.

Home at last, in their own yard,  
Freddy flopped and breathed so hard.  
Dolly hugged him, soft and tight,  
“Best adventure! Love you, goodnight!”

Peter loved his pickle.
He took it everywhere he went.
It was big, bumpy, and bright green.

In the morning, Peter polished his pickle.
He liked it shiny and smooth.
Mum said, “Be gentle, Peter!”

At school, Peter showed his pickle to the teacher.
She gasped, “Oh my… that’s quite a pickle!”
The whole class wanted a peek.

Peter’s pickle didn’t fit in his lunchbox.
So he just held it under the table.
It wriggled out once and caused a commotion.

At the park, Peter swung with his pickle.
But when it got too wild, it flew off!
“Catch my pickle!” he shouted.

A dog chased after it.
Then a lady with a pram.
Peter puffed and panted behind them both.

Finally, he cornered his pickle by the pond.
It was a little wet, but still in one piece.
Peter gave it a careful squeeze.

At Granny’s house, Peter proudly showed her his pickle.
Granny blinked. “Well… I haven’t seen one like that in years.”
She gave it a poke with her knitting needle.

Peter took his pickle to bed.
He tucked it in next to him.
Mum said, “Don’t play with it under the covers.”

One day, Peter’s pickle started to smell funny.
He sniffed it, poked it, and frowned.
“Oh no… it’s going soft!”

Dad inspected the pickle with a serious face.
“This one’s past its prime, lad.”
Peter looked heartbroken.

They buried the pickle in the garden.
Peter said a few words.
Granny brought sandwiches, just not with pickle.

The next morning, something green popped up.
A tiny sprout, wriggling in the dirt.
Peter grinned. “My pickle’s not gone… it’s growing!”

And from that day on, Peter had lots of pickles.
Big ones, bumpy ones, even bendy ones.
He never went anywhere without at least one in his pocket.
